Text styling (markdown?)

Figuring out how to send trees:
	Method 1: client-heavy method. Marionette would be sending empty models (title: "loading", content: "loading", etc) and would also send the object id. Each one would then reload their own data on load. It would look a lot cooler, but it would require a pretty big overhaul. Also, no guarantees that the models can reload on command like that.
	Method 2: server-heavy method. Python replaces all of the id's with data on the documents' way out, and replaces documents with id's on the way in.

Replace documents with id when the data is coming in.
