So this is how I think it's going to map out.
D3 is going to have first-hand access to the data.
It has to render everything nicely into colored, labelled circles.
It also has to save a variable in the marionette view that contains the ID of the current node in view. It's going to start out with the title node.
Everything above and below the current node will be rendered.
The current node needs a nice animation to turn it from a circle into the box of text. (Material design, anyone?)
The circular nodes need nice animations to turn them from hiding into circles, or vice versa.
Everything else is going to be set to hidden (or maybe tiny? idk, whatever looks better)

Questions that need answering:
Do nodes really need to know their parents?

The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill - The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it - and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.",
