## Interactive Choose Your Own Adventure Story Editor
Our program aims to allow users to create their own Choose Your Own Adventure stories!

## TO DO:
 * Login
 * Get acquainted with three.js (for nice visualizations, trees for each storyline split)
 * Get acquainted with Node.js
 * Framework? (maybe Meteor? Marionette?-->Persistance!)
 * Do "public" stories which can be seen by everyone; most popular stories (based on votes) will be displayed on the homepage
 
## TIMELINE:
 * Login system (5/3)
 * Start with basic setup (without three.js); be able to add and store a basic story (5/11)
 * Get basic framework done for back-end development, be able to store stories and alternate paths 
 * Incorporate three.js into our project, make adding splits interactive and easy to navigate (5/17?)
 * Incorporate feature to link all nodes together to create one whole story
