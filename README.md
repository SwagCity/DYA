## Interactive Choose Your Own Adventure Story Editor
Our program aims to allow users to create their own Choose Your Own Adventure stories with ease.

## TO DO:
 * Login System
 * Get acquainted with three.js (for nice visualizations, trees for each storyline split)
 * Figure out how to store nodes and connecting paths
 * Framework? (Marionette?-->Persistance!)
 * Do "public" stories which can be seen by everyone; most popular stories (based on votes) will be displayed on the homepage
 * Include genre tags (so we can display top stories for each genre, etc.)
 * Include private stories which can only be viewed and edited by the author user
 * Use Facebook to Like/Share a story
 * Use upvoting/downvoting system to rate stories
 * Use OAuth so people can log in with Facebook, Google, etc.
